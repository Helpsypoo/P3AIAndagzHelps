Just a small text document to keep track of any information we might need to know and probably convey to the player before the finished game.

- Our four units are currently mapped to QWER for selection.
- You can also right-click on a unit to select it.
- Right clicking on valid terrain will cause the selected unit to try and walk there.
- Left clicking performs the selected unit's contextual action.

ACTIONS SO FAR
	- SHEPHERD
		- When performing action on valid terrain, places a waypoint if there are any in the stash.
		- When performing action on a waypoint, collects that waypoint.


ASSUMED ACTIONS FOR FUTURE
- All units when performing an action on an enemy would attack I presume.
- All units when performing an action a fallen unit would revive.
