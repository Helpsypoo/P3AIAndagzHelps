Thank you for purchasing Simple SciFi Gun Turret Set!

The pack includes 4 turret models that can be used individually or as upgrades for a base gun turret.
Each turret and element comes with its own prefab that you can drag-and-drop in your scenes. 
A small test scene is also provided in order to showcase all the turrets.

**************************************************
Using the pack in a linear workflow.

This pack comes with additional Albedo textures suited for a linear workflow. They are stored inside the "\Textures\Linear\Linear Textures" folder. 

In order to change the demo scene from gamma to linear, go to Edit>Project Settings> Player and change the Color Space from Gamma to Linear. 

Inside the demo scene, navigate to the Lights group and enable the Directional Light 2 for a better view of the objects.
